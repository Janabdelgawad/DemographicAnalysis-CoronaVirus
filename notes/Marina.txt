Prompt : i have data on COVID-19 that includes various fields such as `date`, `country_orig`, `country`, `state`, `active`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `confirmed_total`, `confirmed`, `recovered_total`, `recovered`, `deaths_total`, `deaths`, `SP_POP_TOTL`, `EN_POP_DNST`, `SP_POP_0014_TO`, `SP_POP_1564_TO`, `SP_POP_65UP_TO`, `days_since_first_case`, `days_since_tenth_case`, `days_since_hundredth_case`, `days_since_first_death`, `days_since_tenth_death`, `days_since_hundredth_death`, `confirmed_d2d`, `recovered_d2d`, and `deaths_d2d`.
which observations could be made from these three:
`confirmed_total`, `deaths_total`, `recovered_total` , i am using SAS visual analytics for visualization , guide me through the entire process from defining relationships between the three data fields to the graph that ill be using on SAS visual analytics

Answer: You can use SAS Visual Analytics to create a graph that shows the relationship between `confirmed_total`, `deaths_total`, and `recovered_total` fields in your COVID-19 dataset. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Open SAS Visual Analytics and create a new report.
2. Import your COVID-19 dataset into SAS Visual Analytics.
3. Drag and drop the `confirmed_total`, `deaths_total`, and `recovered_total` fields onto the report canvas.
4. Select the **Bar Chart** visualization type from the **Visualizations** pane.
5. In the **Data** pane, click the **Group Data** button and select the `country` field to group the data by country.
6. In the **Data** pane, click the **Aggregate Data** button and select the **Sum** aggregation method for the `confirmed_total`, `deaths_total`, and `recovered_total` fields.
7. Click the **Run** button to generate the graph.

The resulting graph will show the total number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries for each country in your dataset. You can use this graph to identify trends and patterns in the data, such as which countries have been hit hardest by the pandemic and which countries have been most successful in controlling the spread of the virus.


Prompt: can i  identify anymore trends other than these two: which countries have been hit hardest by the pandemic and which countries have been most successful in controlling the spread of the virus. from the data

Answer:Yes, there are other trends that can be identified from your COVID-19 dataset. Here are some examples:

1. **Mortality rate**: You can calculate the mortality rate for each country by dividing the number of deaths by the number of confirmed cases. This can help you identify countries that have been hit hard by the virus in terms of fatalities.
2. **Recovery rate**: You can calculate the recovery rate for each country by dividing the number of recovered cases by the number of confirmed cases. This can help you identify countries that have been successful in treating the virus.
3. **Growth rate**: You can calculate the growth rate for each country by dividing the number of new cases by the total number of cases. This can help you identify countries where the virus is spreading rapidly.
4. **Demographic trends**: You can analyze the data by age group, gender, or other demographic factors to identify patterns in how the virus is affecting different populations.

To create a graph that shows any of these trends, you can follow the same steps I provided earlier. Simply replace the `confirmed_total`, `deaths_total`, and `recovered_total` fields with the fields you want to analyze, and adjust the aggregation method and visualization type as needed.
